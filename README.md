# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The primary focus of this project is to analyze datasets using EDA techniques and generate insightful visualizations to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform EDA on the provided dataset.
- Explored the structure and characteristics of the data through statistical summaries, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
  
2.  Handling Outliers and Missing Values:
- Identified outliers within the dataset and implemented strategies to handle them effectively.
- Utilized Linear Regression to predict missing values in the dataset, thereby enhancing data completeness and integrity.
